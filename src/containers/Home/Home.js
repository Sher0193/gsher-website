                    <p>Greg Sherwood began creating art in high school and has fond memories of bringing his sketchbooks and art materials along with him on canoe trips with his father.</p>  

                    <p>Greg attended the University of Western Ontario in London where he first studied geology and received his Bachelor degree. He returned to Western to study art and received his Honours Bachelor of Fine Arts and later his Bachelor of Education from Althouse College.</p>  

                    <p>Gregâ€™s interest in science has shaped his life as an artist. He continues to explore his fascination with the natural world, documenting the processes and forces that shape our environment in his oil paintings and mixed media work.</p>

                    <p>Greg worked as a painter and educator in Huron County for 28 years. He currently lives and works as a full time artist in London, Ontario with his wife and has two adult sons.</p>

                    <p>His paintings are in collections throughout Canada and the US.</p>

                    <p>I endeavour with my paintings to express a sense of a particular place through an examination of the environmental and human forces that shape it.  The subjects of the paintings reflect the various aspects of the Ontario landscape, especially those found in Huron and Bruce counties, with emphasis on the water, the fields, the sky and its changing patterns of weather.</p>
